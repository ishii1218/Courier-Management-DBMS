# Courier-Management-DBMS
Courier Management Database System, developed for the EE4350 - Database Systems module, is designed to streamline logistics and delivery operations. By leveraging MySQL and adhering to 2NF standards, we created an optimized schema to handle essential functions like package tracking, employee management, and customer service.

The system includes:

A well-structured ER diagram with 8 strong entities and 2 weak entities.

Support for core database operations such as Insert, Update, and Delete.

20 SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation, including complex joins for operational insights.

Performance optimization through indexing and query tuning to enhance efficiency.

This project highlights our ability to design, implement, and optimize database systems for real-world applications in logistics and delivery services.
